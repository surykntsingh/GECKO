## Organizing Data

Detailed description for curating data for GECKO is provided in the directory [data_curation](https://github.com/bmi-imaginelab/GECKO/tree/main/data_curation). 


## Training

Following curating the data as explained above, we are now ready to feed the extracted Concept Prior and Deep features for pre-training dual-branch MIL using GECKO. 

Example training command:

```
features_dir="/your/lists_feats_dir"
experiment_dir="/your/experiment_dir"
split_path="/your/split_path_dir"

python train_gecko.py --keep_ratio 0.7 --top_k 10 --cross_val_fold 0 --dataset_dict_path "$features_dir/all_dict.pickle" --features_deep_path "$features_dir/deep_features.pth" --features_path "$features_dir/concept_prior.csv" --save_path "$experiment_dir" --split_path "$split_path" 
```

In train_gecko.sh and train_gecko_with_gene.sh bash file, we provide example to conduct cross-validation:

```
# chmod +x train_gecko.sh
# ./train_gecko.sh /your/lists_feats_dir /your/experiment_dir /your/split_path_dir


# chmod +x train_gecko_with_gene.sh
# ./train_gecko_with_gene.sh /your/lists_feats_dir /your/experiment_dir /your/split_path_dir /your/gene_exp_path
```

The Gene Expression data is provided here: [Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AUcj53wuycHowVMFhPcZuYvw6GaXwfsr?usp=drive_link).

## Inference

After training the dual-branch MIL using GECKO, use the following notebook to explore unsupervised evaluation, supervised evaluation, and interpretability analysis.
